🚀 MISSION STATEMENT
I engineer solutions at the bleeding edge of three domains:
💻 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING — Architecting scalable systems, clean code, and elegant algorithms
🎨 3D MODELING & VISUALIZATION — Crafting photorealistic renders, medical visualizations, and interactive experiences
🧬 BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING — Innovating medical devices, biosignal processing, and health tech solutions

"The best innovations emerge when you refuse to stay in one box."
